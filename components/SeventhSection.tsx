            Did you know that it takes about 475 hours to write a novel? Writing a book is no cakewalk. 
            It may even take someone with years of experience ages to finish a book. Did you know that 
            great renowned authors would need to hire a ghostwriter to keep up with the tight schedules, 
            release dates, and market demands? You may never get to know which parts of your favorite books 
            were not written by the author themselves. A ghostwriter specializes in capturing the author's voice, 
            language, and pace as if they're two peas in a pod, so the book doesn't look like it was written 
            by someone else. So even if a renowned expert could need help from a ghostwriter, someone who is 
            not even a writer by profession is sure to need a specialist to help them.
